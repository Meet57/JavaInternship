NETTY

Bootstrap
    starting threads, opening sockets etc

EventLoop
    A Netty EventLoop is a loop that keeps looking for new events, e.g. incoming data
    from network sockets (from SocketChannel) instances).

SocketChannel
    A Netty SocketChannel represents a TCP connection to another computer over a network

ChannelInitializer
    A Netty ChannelInitializer is a special ChannelHandler which is attached to the
    ChannelPipeline of a SocketChannel when the SocketChannel is created. The ChannelInitializer
    is then called so it can initialize the SocketChannel.

ChannelHandler
    A Netty ChannelHandler handles the data that is received from a Netty SocketChannel.
    A ChannelHandler can also handle data that is being written out to a SocketChannel

ChannelPipeline
     The ChannelPipeline contains a list of ChannelHandler instances. When the EventLoop
     reads data from a SocketChannel the data is passed to the first ChannelHandler in the
     ChannelPipeline. The first ChannelHandler processes the data and can choose to forward
     it to the next ChannelHandler in the ChannelPipeline, which then also processes the data
     and can choose to forward it to the next ChannelHandler in the ChannelPipeline etc.
